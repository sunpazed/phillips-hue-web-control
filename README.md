Phillips Hue Web Control
=============

A small utility to update the colour of your Phillips Hue light via a simple webpage control.
Currently untested, and hasily thrown together over an hour or so. 
Please feel free to test and contribute your ideas.

How to use it
-------------

Simply edit huepicker.js and include your API, Host, and Light number to control your Hue.


What's missing
-------------

* Well, it's untested.
* There's lots of nasty hardcoded values. 
* Include the ability to control one or more light.
* Custom palettes.
